Current video games include: Cart-Pole, Breakout, and Flappy Bird. This work is on-going and facilitated through the use of OpenAI's gym and the python deep learning library Keras.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Cart-Pole\r\n\r\n## Breakout\r\n\r\n## Flappy Bird\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Back to profile.](http://mgallow.github.io/)\r\n",
