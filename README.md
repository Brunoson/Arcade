# Arcade

Arcade is a collection of projects in which we utilize the latest research in reinforcement learning (policy gradients, deep q-learning) to allow computers to explore and learn various video games. Current video games include: Cart-Pole, Breakout, and Flappy Bird. This work is on-going and facilitated through the use of OpenAI's gym and the python deep learning library Keras.
